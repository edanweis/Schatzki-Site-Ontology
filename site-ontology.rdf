    <dc:description xml:lang="en">This ontology provides a basic standardized vocabulary, (also known as "schema") that is an attempt to formalise Ted Schatzki's social theory of "site ontology". The purpose of this ontology is to structure empirical data generated by research on social practices, using the OWL language and general knowledge modeling principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
The idea is to advance a shared conceptualisation of Schatzki's site ontology which can be used in a variety of applications. The use of semantic web technology (OWL and RDF databases) allows researchers to link their data to other sources on the web, while maintaining interoperability between them. By translating empirical reseach on social practices into RDF and sharing it in this way, we unlock the possiblities for representing, analysing and re-using the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
Some examples of how this ontology can be used include, the creation of graph visualizations representing the large scale practice-order meshes; structuring high volumes of data from social media channels into practice-order meshes; facilitating data collection for researchers adopting schatzki's theory of practice and demarcating the field of arrangements; analysing the data contained in such large-scale practice-order meshes by querying for specific patterns against a database of empirical observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
This ontology has been created as part of ongoing PhD research project by Edan Weis at the University of Melbourne. &#xD;

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Practical understandings are certain abilities that pertain to the actions composing a practice. &#xD;
&#xD;
1. Knowing how to X&#xD;
2. Knowing how to identify X-ings&#xD;
3. Knowing how to prompt as well as respond to X-ings.&#xD;
&#xD;
For basic actions, knowing how to X is a motor- or perceptual-cognitive skill. For nonbasic actions, knowing how to X is knowing which of the doings and saying of which one is capable would, in the circumstances, constitute X-ing.&#xD;
&#xD;
Practical understandings are not a sort of know-how that, according to several prominent theorists of practice, lies behind much, if not all, human behavior in its finely tuned sensitivity to immediate setting and wider context. Rather, practical understanding is a skill or capacity that underlies activity. It almost never determines what makes sense to people to do nor does it govern what people do.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="CausalRelation">
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A causal relation is the relation of "bringing about". Causal relations hold among entities by virtue of action: either by virtue of action having some effect or by virtue of something triggering action. &#xD;
&#xD;
There are two forms of this relation:&#xD;
&#xD;
1. One entity’s actions making something happen. When someone makes something happen, what happens, as it were, just happens. The actor is responsible for what occurs, and what happens itself does nothing in order to happen&#xD;
&#xD;
2. One entity’s actions or conditions leading to another entity’s action(s). When something leads to someone’s action, the person who responds carries responsibility for the effect: He or she does something that constitutes the response and usually could have acted differently.</rdfs:comment>

&#xD;
Rules of the present sort are not explicitizations of previously unarticulated understandings. Nor are they tacit or implicit formulas or contents.

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Entities are the components which make up social life. This typology is not meant to be an unassailable, immutable, or mutually exclusive classification of either the entities that are or those that enter social life. It claims only to be a useful, experientially based sorting of the entities significant to humans through which their lives hang together. Nor does it pretend to be either the only sensible or the “natural” taxonomy of significant coexistence-mediating beings. It is simply an effective and adequately comprehensive parsing of the entities amid and through which people inter-relatedly live. The purpose to which site ontology is directed is understanding social life; to this end, it is reasonable to construct a straightforward experiential typology that classifies entities on the bases of their standings vis-à-vis human activity and of their significance for human coexistence.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Artifact">
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Artifacts are the products of human activity. This means that they exist because of human doing. An artifact is anything that human activity produces. No products of human activity qualify as nonartifactual. Artifacts are not just overtly artificial constructions such as computers, machines, texts, works of art, and buildings, but in addition modifications of “nature” such as altered landscapes, cooked meat, packaged herbs, and re-engineered human bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
Under the category of artifacts, moreover, three overlapping types can be distinguished on the phenomenalistic grounds of source, relatedness to human activity, and significance for social existence:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Fabrications": These are products of human activity for which things of nature serve as the material. Their production involves a reworking of natural entities and a disappearance of these entities in their original form. Most use objects (equipment), built architectural structures, and works of art fall into this class.&#xD;
&#xD;
“Mongrels”: Refers to former natural phenomena, either to which humans have added something, in which they have induced some change, or which would not have existed if it were not for human activity. In each case, human activity either induces some basic alteration in or is responsible for the fundamental form, composition, or existence of the entity. Examples include the ozone hole, global warming, hybrid corn, and whales outfitted with sonar devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
“intelligent machines”: Those products of human artifice that 1. perform or take over cognitive operations previously associated with or performed by humans and/or 2. are able in some way to produce themselves (for instance, through engineering or learning). Sensor-equipped robots and digital machines are some examples.</rdfs:comment>

  <owl:Class rdf:ID="Organism">
    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">Organisms and things whose form, inner structure, and existence have been relatively little, if at all, affected by human beings. El Niño, earthquakes, lions on the Serengeti, polar bears in Arctic climes, tubular life in continental rift zones, canopy birds in tropical rain forests and geological strata immediately below the surface of the earth. These entities are beings of nature, despite the fact that human activity has not left them undisturbed.&#xD;
&#xD;
Not all organisms, furthermore, are natural phenomena. The herbs growing in a Shaker physics garden or in a pot in the corner of a day trading room are examples because their existence in these places results from human activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
The division of life into persons and living organisms, moreover, is neither exclusive nor fixed. Persons, of course, are living organisms. What warrants the dual categories is the experienced, unavoidably reckoned-with rich and multidimensional distinctiveness of humans as opposed to other living creatures.</rdfs:comment>

    <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">A teleoaffective structure is a range of normativized and hierarchically ordered ends, projects, and tasks, to varying degrees allied with normativized emotions and even moods.  &#xD;
&#xD;
Western cooking practices, for instance, are typically heavy on teleological and light on affective structure, whereas Western rearing practices display considerably more of the affective. To say that doings and sayings are linked by a teleoaffective structure is to say that they pursue end-project combinations that are contained in the same teleoaffective structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
Teleoaffective structure is not a set of properties of actors. It is, instead, the property of a practice: a set of ends, projects, and affectivities that, as a collection, is 1. expressed in the openended set of doings and sayings that compose the practice and 2. unevenly incorporated into different participants’ minds and actions.</rdfs:comment>

The entities that compose social orders also assume positions in spatialities of nonphysical sorts. This includes activity-place space (constituted by actions and where they occur). Spaces of this sort are composed of places and paths, where a place is defined as a location to X (where X is an action), and a path is defined as a place of a particular sort, namely, a place to get from one location to another. &#xD;
&#xD;
Physical entities are often anchored to places where activity-place spaces occur. Eg: the layout of a laboratory determines the interdependence, sequence and nesting of human actions.</rdfs:comment>

Ways that the mesh of practices and orders makes courses of action easier, harder, simpler, more complicated, shorter, longer, ill-advised, promising of ruin, promising of gain, disruptive, facilitating, obligatory or proscribed, acceptable or unacceptable, more or less relevant, riskier or safer, more or less feasible, more or less likely to induce ridicule or approbation— as well as physically impossible or possible and feasible or unfeasible.&#xD;

They make certain courses of action difficult, ill-advised, circuitous, disruptive, and not very feasible. They figure paths as distinct or fuzzy, more threatening or welcoming, more unsurveyable or straightforward, more cognitively dissonant or soothing, smoother or more jagged, more disagreeable or appealing. Courses of action are easier or harder, simpler or more complicated, safer or riskier, obligatory or proscribed because of the practices people carry on and the orders amid which they do so. &#xD;
